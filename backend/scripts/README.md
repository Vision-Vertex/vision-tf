## 🔧 Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Windows Users
All scripts work on Windows through Docker. The scripts detect the operating system and provide appropriate instructions.

**Windows Workflow:**
```bash
# Start containers
docker-compose up -d

# Run setup inside container
docker exec vision-tf-backend ./scripts/setup-db.sh

# View logs
docker logs vision-tf-backend
```

### Linux/macOS Users
Scripts work natively on Linux and macOS.

**Linux/macOS Workflow:**
```bash
# Complete setup
./scripts/dev-setup.sh

# Daily development
./scripts/dev/dev-start.sh
./scripts/dev/dev-logs.sh
./scripts/dev/dev-stop.sh
```

## 🎯 Common Workflows

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start development
./scripts/dev/dev-start.sh

# View logs (if needed)
./scripts/dev/dev-logs.sh -f

# Stop when done
./scripts/dev/dev-stop.sh
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check what's wrong
./scripts/utils/health-check.sh

# View logs for debugging
./scripts/dev/dev-logs.sh -s backend

# Reset everything if needed
./scripts/dev/dev-reset.sh
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Create backup
./scripts/db/db-backup.sh

# Restore from backup
./scripts/db/db-restore.sh ./backups/vision-tf-backup-20250807_143022.sql
```

### Cleanup
```bash
# Remove containers only
./scripts/utils/cleanup.sh

# Remove everything (fresh start)
./scripts/utils/cleanup.sh --all
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Database Data**: Using `--volumes` or `--all` with cleanup scripts will **permanently delete** your database data.
2. **Environment Variables**: Always edit `.env` file before running setup scripts.
3. **Docker Permissions**: On Linux, you may need to use `sudo` for Docker commands.
4. **Windows**: Use Docker Desktop and run commands in WSL2 or Git Bash for best compatibility.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker not running**
   ```bash
   # Start Docker
   sudo systemctl start docker  # Linux
   # Or start Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS
   ```

2. **Permission denied**
   ```bash
   # Make scripts executable
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh scripts/*/*.sh
   ```

3. **Port conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Check what's using the port
   sudo lsof -i :3000
   
   # Stop conflicting service
   sudo systemctl stop postgresql  # if local PostgreSQL is running
   ```

4. **Container won't start**
   ```bash
   # Check logs
   ./scripts/dev/dev-logs.sh -s backend
   
   # Reset everything
   ./scripts/dev/dev-reset.sh
   ```
